\begin{abstract}
  Modern multicore systems operate under relaxed memory models, where the
  observable behavior of concurrent programs may diverge significantly from
  sequentially consistent executions. While many existing verification techniques
  for concurrent data structures assume sequential consistency, practical systems
  and language runtimes expose weaker memory semantics, thereby complicating
  formal reasoning about correctness.

  This report investigates the problem of verifying correctness properties of
  concurrent algorithms under different memory models, with particular emphasis on
  atomicity, linearizability, and progress guarantees. Rather than treating
  verification as a secondary concern following algorithm design, we position it
  as the primary challenge in reasoning about modern concurrent systems.

  As a concrete vehicle for this study, we examine multi-word compare-and-swap
  (hereinafter \emph{MCAS}) \cite{Harris2002} algorithms, which serve as a representative and
  demanding case study for modern verification techniques. We survey existing
  verification methodologies and tools, and identify open challenges in reasoning
  about linearizability under language-level memory models.
